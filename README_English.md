**Some tips for people who want to start a JS user group in their city and don't know where to start.**
> A short and general handbook based on our experience with [Milano JS](http://milanojs.com). Maybe it won't work for your group, but it's highly likely it will. :)

:warning: If you have questions open an [issue](https://github.com/milano-js/city-js/issues/new), we'll answer as soon as possible. If we believe the question is of general interest it will be added below.

:it: Speaking Italian? Check the [Italian version](README.md)!

## Structure of a meeting
- 5-minute introduction with updates about the community
- One talk each night, lasting between 40 minutes and an hour
- Questions & Answers
- Information about the next meeting

Try to avoid "introductory" talks, YouTube is full of them. Real examples and practical applications always generate more interest.

A talk of this length allows to go deep in the chosen topic and leaves space for a short introduction for those who know nothing about it.

## Frequence of meetings
- One meeting per month is optimal

A regular frequency is very important also to let the people attending get used to it. Choose a day and try to always follow it. Milano JS, for example, is on the first Tuesday of every month (excluding bank holidays or exceptional situations).

## Speaker
Initially it won't be easy to find speakers, so start with the people you know and trust (for their competence).

Use some [guidelines](https://github.com/milano-js/talk-guidelines) for the speakers you do not know.

## Organising
Some people love [Meetup](http://www.meetup.com/), some don't. We use [Eventbrite](https://www.eventbrite.com/) because it allows you to handle many things well, like tickets, waiting list, check-in, etc.

## Promotion

- Twitter
- Facebook
- Newsletter
- Website

Twitter could be the best channel, but unfortunately not all developers use it regularly.

Facebook can reach many other people. You can use an [IFTTT](https://ifttt.com/recipes) recipe to automatically post your Tweets to a Facebook page. Minimum effort, maximum return!

A website (a simple static page using [GH pages](https://pages.github.com/) is fine) must be the reference point and must be always up to date with the information about the next meeting. You can use a free subdomain offered by http://dns.js.org and redirect it to your GitHub Pages.

A newsletter might sound vintage but is a great tool, just don't abuse it.

## Location
The location is obviously very important. First of all it must be very spacious and, if possible, easy to reach with public transport.

A coworking space is ideal, but also being hosted by a company is a good option.  In this case you could have some limitations due to sponsors.

## Sponsor
- Regular sponsors
- Sponsors for one night

Finding regular sponsors to give away gadgets, software licenses, etc. is not hard after you have a consolidated group.  [Jetbrains](https://www.jetbrains.com/devnet/) for example has a programme for communities and offers licenses for its products.

Finding someone to sponsor a single night or a special event could instead be more difficult. Before asking a sponsorship to a company, find something to offer in exchange. If you group is big, companies will definitely be more interested in sponsoring your event.

## Logo
A logo is very important to get recognised. A classic is to use [JavaScript's "official" logo](https://github.com/voodootikigod/logo.js/) adding a detail that represents your city.
